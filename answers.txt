1.- Explain the difference between Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and Acceptance Tests.

3.- Explain how Test-Driven Development (TDD) works and why it is important to use it.
R: The requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. And it's important because you refreact the code at the same time to the development, so the code does not change much.

4.- Explain how Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery works and list its benefits.
They aim to automate code reviews, testing and deployment. Via workflows or pipelines where the code is clone, review, test and deploy if it meets the requirements.

5.- What is the difference between a monolithic application and an application based in
